This project is a Java 21 Gradle application.
Please generate idiomatic Java code and follow Gradle conventions.
The purpose of this project is to implement a NCPDP Telecommunication Standard (NCPDP) parser.
The parser should be able to read and parse NCPDP files, extract relevant data, and provide methods to access the parsed information.
The NCPDP standard is a set of guidelines for electronic healthcare transactions, and the parser should be able to handle different versions of the standard.
The parser should be able to handle different types of NCPDP files, including but not limited to:
- Claims files
- Eligibility files
- Payment files
The parser should be able to handle different types of NCPDP transactions, including but not limited to:
- Claims transactions
- Eligibility transactions
- Payment transactions
The parser should be able to handle different types of NCPDP segments, including but not limited to:
- Header segments
- Detail segments
- Trailer segments
The parser should be able to handle different types of NCPDP fields, including but not limited to:
- Fixed-length fields
- Variable-length fields
The parser should be able to handle different types of NCPDP data types, including but not limited to:
- Numeric data types
- Alphanumeric data types
- Date data types
The parser should be able to handle different types of NCPDP delimiters, including but not limited to:
- Pipe delimiters
- Caret delimiters
The parser should be able to handle different types of NCPDP encodings, including but not limited to:
- ASCII encoding
